Test code for event stream modeling and monitoring.

This code was written for a BV Engineering Blog Post:  <link to be added once published>

The visualization is done using the Bokeh package:  https://bokeh.pydata.org

The code targets Python version 3.6.3

Each "test" file stands alone, and uses the data.py and FadingStatistics.py files (and Bokeh).  To run a test file is easy, e.g.:

```python
python test_noise.py
```
